# Thermal-Resistance-of-a-heatsink

This is a group project based on finding the optimal number of fins for a heatsink. The thermal resistance to number of fins is graphed using the files in the folder (Heat_Sink_Program). The first python program (heatsink_thermal_resistance) uses the equations in the scientific papers attatched (HeatsinkDesignMethodolgy.pdf, and HeatsinkPressureDropAnalysis.pdf), extracting experimental measurements for the interlinked static pressure and airflow through the heatsink, from the excel file also attatched (Copy of FanCurveData). The excel file and python programs must be in the same folder. Using this data and an input for number of fins, it iterates to a specific value, and saves it to a text file. After repeating this with the range of possible fins, the second python program (Thermal_Resistance_Graph_Program) then graphs the results. Heatsink_Modelling_and_Characterization_Group_Report explains the whole project and includes more details of the code. All variables are defined at the beginning of the python program. Both programs were written by me, Cameron Hart.
