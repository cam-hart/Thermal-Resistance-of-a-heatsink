# Thermal-Resistance-of-a-heatsink

This is a group project based on finding the optimal number of fins for a heatsink. Using the files included (Heatsink Design Methodology) and (Heatsink Pressure drop), the thermal resistance to number of fins is graphed using the python files included. Further details are explained in the group report (Heatsink-Modelling-and-Characterization-Group-Report)
